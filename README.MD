Movie Anaylzer using the Two Clocks Method:
Uses two different method to analyze movies
1. Script + SRT (complex)
2. Only SRT (simple)

This project implements the idea of using two clocks to analyze plays and movie scripts. An idea represented in “The Tale of Two Clocks” by Zvi Lotker.
The Two Clocks algorithm identify critical events in a given relationship network using the drift between two clocks.
Analyzing movie scripts and their subtitles to output the exact moments of critical events in a given movie and represent these moments in a graph that is later applied to the movie!
